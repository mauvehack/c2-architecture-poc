# Payload Staging Directory

## **Purpose**
This directory serves as the hosting root for generated artifacts and stage-0 payloads.

In a live operation, the Team Server utilizes this path to:
1.  **Serve Stagers:** Host initial access vectors (e.g., HTA, PowerShell scripts).
2.  **Store Artifacts:** Save compiled implant binaries generated by the build process.
3.  **Exfiltration Landing:** (Optional) Temporary storage for small exfiltrated files before database ingestion.

## **Operational Security (OPSEC)**
> **Warning:** Do not commit live malware, shellcode, or active binaries to this repository. This folder should remain empty in the source control version to prevent flagging by GitHub security scanners.
